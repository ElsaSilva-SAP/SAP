# Day 5 (Friday): Optional Exercise – API in Daily Life
## *(Optional)* Find Everyday Examples of “API-Like” Connections

This exercise is **optional**. Use it to make **APIs** more concrete with examples from daily life.

---

## 🎯 What You Will Do

List **2 everyday examples** where something like an **API** connects two systems (e.g. an app and a service). Write **one sentence** per example explaining the connection.

---

## Example 1

**App or situation:** ___________________________________________

**What two “systems” are connected?** (e.g. weather app ↔ weather service; payment app ↔ bank)

> ___________________________________________
> ___________________________________________

**One sentence:** ___________________________________________
___________________________________________

## 💡 Ideas (you can use different ones)

- **Weather app on your phone** – The app asks a weather service for data (like an API call) and shows it to you.
- **Payment app (e.g. paying in a shop)** – The app talks to your bank or card network to check balance and complete the payment.
- **Travel booking site** – The site asks airlines or hotels for availability and prices, then shows them to you.
- **Social login (“Sign in with Google”)** – The website asks Google to confirm who you are instead of managing its own password for you.

---

## 🎉 Key Takeaway

- **APIs** are how different **systems or apps** request and exchange **data or actions** in a defined way. Many everyday apps rely on similar “connections” behind the scenes.
