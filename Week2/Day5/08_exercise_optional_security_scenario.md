# Day 5 (Friday): Optional Exercise – Security Scenario
## *(Optional)* Apply Information Security to a Situation

This exercise is **optional**. Use it to reinforce **information security** components (access control, encryption, incident response, security policies).

---

## 🎯 What You Will Do

Read the short scenario below. List **2 security actions** the company should take. For each action, say which **information security component** it relates to (access control, encryption, incident response, or security policies).

---

## Scenario

**“An employee has left the company. They used to have access to SAP (finance, HR data) and company email. The IT team wants to make sure the company is protected.”**

## Your Answers

**Security action 1:** ___________________________________________
___________________________________________

**Which component does it relate to?** ___________________________________________

**Security action 2:** ___________________________________________
___________________________________________

**Which component does it relate to?** ___________________________________________

## 💡 Example Ideas

- **Revoke all SAP and system access immediately** → **Access control** (only authorized users should have access).
- **Disable or change their email account and forward important emails** → **Access control**.
- **Review what data they could have accessed or exported before leaving** → **Incident response** (assess and document).
- **Ensure policy says access must be removed on the day of leaving** → **Security policies** (clear rules for offboarding).

*(Encryption is more about protecting data in transit or at rest; it might come in if you discuss securing data they had access to.)*

## 🤔 Short Reflection *(Optional)*

**Why is it important to remove access as soon as someone leaves?**

## 🎉 Key Takeaway

- **Access control** = who can access what; removing access when someone leaves is a basic security action.
- **Policies** and **incident response** (e.g. review, document) support consistent and safe offboarding.
