# Day 5 (Friday): Group Exercise – APIs, CX, and Security in Practice
## Three Different Day 5 Scenarios for Three Groups

Work in **one of three groups**. Each group has a **different scenario** based on today’s topics: **APIs & integration**, **Customer experience (CX)**, or **Information security**. Your group will complete the task and present to the class.

---

## 👥 Group Setup

**Instructions:**
- The class is split into **3 groups**.
- **Group 1** → Scenario A (API & integration)
- **Group 2** → Scenario B (Customer experience / UX)
- **Group 3** → Scenario C (Information security)
- Assign roles: **Facilitator**, **Recorder**, **Presenter**
- Complete your group’s task, then present in about **5 minutes**

**Your group number:** _____ (1 / 2 / 3)

**Your group members:**
1. ___________________________________________
2. ___________________________________________
3. ___________________________________________
4. ___________________________________________

**Your role:** ___________________________________________

## 📋 Scenario A – Group 1: API & Integration

**Your scenario:** A company wants to **connect SAP** to their **e-commerce website** so that when a customer places an order online, the order is created in SAP automatically. Data must flow: website → SAP (order, customer data). No manual re-entry.

**Your task:** As a group, list **3 things** the company should consider or plan for when doing this integration. Think about: what data flows, who builds/maintains the connection, security, and what “API” or “middleware” might do.

| # | Consideration or action | Brief reason |
|---|--------------------------|--------------|
| 1 | ___________________________________________ | ___________________________________________ |
| 2 | ___________________________________________ | ___________________________________________ |
| 3 | ___________________________________________ | ___________________________________________ |

**Example ideas:** “Define which data the website sends (order ID, customer, items).” “Use SAP APIs or middleware so the connection is standard and secure.” “Ensure only authorized systems can call the API (e.g. authentication).”

**Presentation:** In 5 min, explain the scenario and your 3 considerations.

## 📋 Scenario B – Group 2: Customer Experience (CX) / UX

**Your scenario:** The **sales team** has started using a new **SAP app** for orders and customer data, but many find it **confusing and slow**. They still prefer the old way (spreadsheets, email). Management wants better **adoption** and a better **user experience**.

**Your task:** As a group, suggest **3 improvements** based on today’s CX/UX ideas (user research, journey mapping, service design, UI design). For each improvement, say which **CX component** it relates to and why it might help adoption.

| # | Improvement | Which CX component? | Why it helps adoption |
|---|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | ___________________________________________ | ___________________________________________ | ___________________________________________ |
| 2 | ___________________________________________ | ___________________________________________ | ___________________________________________ |
| 3 | ___________________________________________ | ___________________________________________ | ___________________________________________ |

**Example ideas:** “Run short user interviews to find the top 3 pain points (user research).” “Simplify the order screen so the main action is one tap (UI design).” “Provide a short journey map of ‘create order’ and remove unnecessary steps (journey mapping).”

**Presentation:** In 5 min, explain the scenario and your 3 improvements.

## 📋 Scenario C – Group 3: Information Security

**Your scenario:** The company is **moving SAP to the cloud** (e.g. SAP S/4HANA Cloud). They want to make sure **data and access** are secure. They are thinking about: who can access what, data in transit and at rest, and what to do if something goes wrong.

**Your task:** As a group, list **3 security actions or policies** the company should have. For each, name the **information security component** it relates to (access control, encryption, incident response, or security policies) and give a short reason.

| # | Security action or policy | Component | Reason |
|---|----------------------------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | ___________________________________________ | _________________ | ___________________________________________ |
| 2 | ___________________________________________ | _________________ | ___________________________________________ |
| 3 | ___________________________________________ | _________________ | ___________________________________________ |

**Example ideas:** “Define roles so only finance sees financial data (access control).” “Encrypt data when sending between cloud and user devices (encryption).” “Have a clear process to follow if a breach is suspected (incident response).” “Policy: passwords must be strong and changed every 90 days (security policies).”

**Presentation:** In 5 min, explain the scenario and your 3 security actions/policies.

## 📢 Presenting to the Class

**Presenter:** Share:
1. Which scenario your group had (API & integration / CX–UX / Information security)
2. Your 3 points (considerations, improvements, or security actions)
3. One challenge or question your group discussed

**Notes:**

## 🤔 Discussion (After All Groups)

**How do APIs, CX, and security work together in a real SAP project?** *(e.g. integration needs secure APIs; good UX helps people use the system safely.)*

## 🎉 Key Takeaways

- **APIs** enable integration; planning data flow, security, and who maintains the connection is important.
- **CX/UX** (user research, journey, UI) drives adoption; listening to users and simplifying the experience helps.
- **Security** (access control, encryption, incident response, policies) protects data and systems, especially when moving to the cloud.
