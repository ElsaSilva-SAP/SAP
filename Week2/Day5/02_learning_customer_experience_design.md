## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:
- ✅ Define customer experience (CX) design
- ✅ Name the main components: user research, journey mapping, service design, UI design
- ✅ Explain why CX matters for adoption and productivity (e.g. in SAP)
- ✅ Give one example of good vs poor UX in a business context

## Part 1: What Is Customer Experience (CX) Design?

**Customer Experience (CX) design** is **creating and optimizing interactions** between a customer and a company to **meet or exceed customer expectations**, **increase satisfaction and loyalty**, and deliver a consistent experience. It covers **all touchpoints** a customer has with the brand (website, app, in-store, support, etc.).

In **business software** (e.g. SAP), “customers” are often **internal users** (employees, partners). So CX design here means **user experience (UX)** – making systems **easy, clear, and efficient** to use so people adopt them and work better.

## Part 2: Components of CX Design

| Component | What it means |
|-----------|----------------|
| **User research** | Understanding user needs, preferences, and behaviors through interviews, surveys, observation |
| **Journey mapping** | Visualizing the user’s journey across touchpoints and interactions (steps, emotions, pain points) |
| **Service design** | Designing the **services and processes** that support the experience (e.g. how support handles a request) |
| **User interface (UI) design** | Designing the **visual and interactive elements** of digital interfaces (screens, navigation, feedback) |

## Part 3: Good vs Poor UX (Business Context)

| Good UX | Poor UX |
|---------|---------|
| Clear labels, few clicks to complete a task | Confusing menus, many steps for simple tasks |
| Consistent layout and behavior across screens | Inconsistent navigation; users get lost |
| Helpful error messages and validation | Cryptic errors; users don’t know what went wrong |
| Works well on the device users have (e.g. mobile) | Only works on one device or browser |
| Fast response so users aren’t waiting | Slow screens; users assume the system is broken |

**Why this matters for SAP:** If the **user experience** is poor, people avoid the system, work around it, or make more errors. **SAP Fiori** is SAP’s approach to a modern, consistent, user-friendly interface – better UX leads to better **adoption** and **productivity**.
