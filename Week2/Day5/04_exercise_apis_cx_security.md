# Day 5 (Friday): Exercise – APIs, Customer Experience, and Security
## Matching and Scenario

Use what you learned about **applications & APIs**, **customer experience design**, and **information security** to complete the activities below.

---

## 🎯 What You Will Do

- Match concepts to definitions (API, CX, security components)
- Apply requirements to a scenario (secure, easy-to-use SAP for mobile users)
- Reflect on why CX matters for SAP adoption

---

## Activity 1: Match Concept to Definition

**Instructions:** Match each term to the correct short definition.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| API | A) Designing interactions to meet or exceed customer/user expectations and improve satisfaction |
| Front-end | B) Interfaces that let different software systems interact and share data |
| Access control | C) The user interface and experience – what the user sees and interacts with |
| CX design | D) Restricting access to information and systems to authorized users only |
| Encryption | E) Converting data into a coded format unreadable without a decryption key |

**Your answers:** API → _____ | Front-end → _____ | Access control → _____ | CX design → _____ | Encryption → _____

**Check:** API–B, Front-end–C, Access control–D, CX design–A, Encryption–E

## Activity 2: Scenario – Secure and Easy-to-Use SAP for Mobile Users

**Scenario:** A company wants to give **sales staff** secure, **easy-to-use** access to **SAP from their mobile devices** (e.g. to check orders, create quotes, update customer data). They are concerned about security (data on phones, lost devices) and about adoption (sales must find it simple or they won’t use it).

**Your task:** For each area, write **one requirement** the company should consider.

| Area | One requirement |
|------|------------------|
| **Security** (e.g. access control, encryption, policy) | ___________________________________________ |
| **Customer experience / UX** (e.g. ease of use, clarity, mobile) | ___________________________________________ |
| **Technical** (e.g. how mobile connects to SAP) | ___________________________________________ |

**Example ideas:** Security – “Only authorized users; data on device encrypted; remote wipe if device is lost.” UX – “Same look and key actions as desktop; max 3 taps for common tasks.” Technical – “Use SAP mobile app or Fiori; connect via secure API.”

## Activity 3: Security Component – Which One?

**Instructions:** For each situation, choose the **most relevant** information security component: **Access control**, **Encryption**, **Incident response**, or **Security policies**.

| # | Situation | Your answer |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | The company will define who can approve purchase orders above €50,000. | _________________ |
| 2 | Customer data sent between the mobile app and SAP must not be readable if intercepted. | _________________ |
| 3 | If a breach is suspected, the team must follow a defined process to contain and fix it. | _________________ |
| 4 | All employees must use passwords of at least 12 characters and change them every 90 days. | _________________ |

**Check:** 1–Access control | 2–Encryption | 3–Incident response | 4–Security policies

## 🤔 Reflection

**Why is customer experience (CX/UX) important for SAP adoption?** *(e.g. adoption, productivity, errors.)*

## 🎉 Key Takeaways

- **APIs** enable integration; **CX/UX** drives adoption and productivity; **security** (access control, encryption, incident response, policies) protects data and systems.
- A **secure, easy-to-use mobile SAP** scenario needs requirements from **security**, **UX**, and **technical** areas.
