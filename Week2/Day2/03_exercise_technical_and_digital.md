## Activity 1: Technical Modules Matching

**Instructions:** Match each description to **Development**, **Integration**, or **System administration**.

| # | Description                                                                    | Your answer               |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 1 | Connecting SAP to the warehouse management system so orders flow automatically | **Integration**           |
| 2 | Writing a custom report in ABAP so finance can see monthly costs by department | **Development**           |
| 3 | Monitoring system performance and planning the next upgrade                    | **System administration** |

| 5 | Setting up secure access so only HR can see employee salaries                  | **System administration** |


**Check:** 1 – Integration | 2 – Development | 3 – System administration | 4 – Development | 5 – System administration

## Activity 2: Before & After Digital Transformation

**Instructions:** Fill in one “before” and one “after” for the same process.

**Example process:** Customer places an order

|                   | Before (traditional)                                                          | After (digital)                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Your example:** | Customer calls sales representative who manually enters order into the system | Customer orders directly through an online portal or mobile app with automatic confirmation |


**Another process (your choice):** Employee submits vacation request

|          | Before (traditional)                                        | After (digital)                                                                                    |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **How?** | Employee fills out paper form and manager signs it manually | Employee submits request in HR system; manager approves digitally and system updates automatically |

## Activity 3: Match Element to Impact

**Instructions:** Draw a line (or write the letter) matching each **element** of digital transformation to an **impact**.

| Element | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 1. Workforce enablement | A) Fosters flexibility, collaboration, rapid response to change |
| 2. Technology integration (AI, IoT, cloud) | B) Training and resources so employees can use new tools |
| 3. Leadership & governance | C) Modernizes operations (e.g. automation, real-time data) |
| 4. Cultural change (agility) | D) Executive sponsorship, steering committees, clear roles |
| 5. Customer experience | E) Personalization, omnichannel, better feedback and engagement |

**Your answers:** 1 → _____ | 2 → _____ | 3 → _____ | 4 → _____ | 5 → _____

**Check:** 1–B, 2–C, 3–D, 4–A, 5–E

## 🤔 Reflection

**Why is leadership important for digital transformation?**

> Leadership is important because it provides direction, vision, and resources for digital initiatives. Leaders ensure that digital transformation aligns with business strategy and help employees adapt to change. Without strong executive support, digital projects may fail due to resistance, lack of coordination, or unclear priorities.

## 🎉 Key Takeaways

- **Technical** = development, integration, system administration.
- **Digital transformation** has clear “before” and “after” in how work is done.
- **Elements** (workforce, technology, leadership, culture, CX) each have specific **impacts**.
