# Day 4 (Thursday): Exercise – Requirements and Alignment
## Identify Requirements and Match Alignment Types

Use what you learned about **business requirements** and **organizational alignment** to complete the activities below.

---

## 🎯 What You Will Do

- Identify functional and non-functional requirements from short scenarios
- Match alignment types to scenarios
- Reflect on why technical requirements matter for SAP

---

## Activity 1: Requirements from Scenarios

**Instructions:** For each scenario, write **at least one functional requirement** and **at least one non-functional requirement**.

**Scenario A:** A company wants to implement SAP to manage **finance and HR**. They have 500 employees and need payroll, recruitment, and financial reporting.

| Type | Your requirement |
|------|-------------------|
| **Functional (what the system must do)** | ___________________________________________ |
| **Non-functional (how well)** | ___________________________________________ |

**Scenario B:** A **retailer** wants to connect SAP to their online shop and warehouses. Orders must flow automatically; customers must see real-time stock.

| Type | Your requirement |
|------|-------------------|
| **Functional** | ___________________________________________ |
| **Non-functional** | ___________________________________________ |

**Scenario C:** A **manufacturer** needs SAP for production planning and quality checks. The shop floor has limited IT support.

| Type | Your requirement |
|------|-------------------|
| **Functional** | ___________________________________________ |
| **Non-functional** | ___________________________________________ |

## Activity 2: Match Alignment Type to Scenario

**Instructions:** For each scenario, choose the **most relevant** alignment type: **Strategic**, **Cultural**, **Structural**, or **Operational**.

| # | Scenario | Your answer |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 1 | The company’s strategy is “digital first,” but IT and business rarely meet to plan projects. | _________________ |
| 2 | Teams are rewarded for “doing their own job” only; collaboration across departments is low. | _________________ |
| 3 | Daily processes (e.g. order entry) don’t follow the new SAP workflows; people use old workarounds. | _________________ |
| 4 | The organization chart has no clear owner for “customer experience”; several departments touch the customer. | _________________ |

**Suggested:** 1 – Strategic | 2 – Cultural | 3 – Operational | 4 – Structural

## Activity 3: Requirement Type Sort

**Instructions:** Label each requirement as **F** (functional), **NF** (non-functional), **S** (stakeholder), or **T** (technical).

| # | Requirement | Your label |
|---|-------------|------------|
| 1 | “Finance must run month-end closing in SAP.” | _____ |
| 2 | “The system must be available 99.5% of the time.” | _____ |
| 3 | “We need SAP HANA as the database.” | _____ |
| 4 | “HR users need a simple screen to approve leave requests.” | _____ |
| 5 | “Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.” | _____ |

**Check:** 1–F, 2–NF, 3–T, 4–S (or F), 5–NF

## 🤔 Reflection

**Why do technical requirements matter for SAP implementations?** *(e.g. infrastructure, performance, integration.)*

## 🎉 Key Takeaways

- **Functional** = what the system does; **non-functional** = how well it does it.
- **Alignment** (strategic, cultural, structural, operational) helps organizations work toward the same goals.
- **Technical requirements** define the foundation (infrastructure, performance) that SAP runs on.
