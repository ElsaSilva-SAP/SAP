# Day 4 (Thursday): Understanding Business Requirements
## What Requirements Are and How They Apply in SAP

Yesterday you finished business goals and process alignment (processes, mapping, analysis, redesign). **Today** we focus on **business requirements** – the activities, needs, and criteria an organization must meet to achieve its goals – and how they are used in SAP projects.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:
- ✅ Define business requirements and why they matter
- ✅ Name the main requirement types: functional, non-functional, stakeholder, technical
- ✅ Give examples of each type in an SAP context
- ✅ Connect requirements to project scope and solution design

---

## 📌 Recap

- **Day 1–2:** SAP product strategy, modules (functional & technical), digital transformation.
- **Day 3:** Business processes, KPIs, process mapping, analysis, redesign.
- **Today:** Business requirements and organizational alignment; operating systems and elastic computing.

## Part 1: What Are Business Requirements?

**Business requirements** are the **critical activities, needs, and criteria** that an organization must meet to achieve its goals and objectives.

They are used to:
- **Define project scope** – what is in and out of the project
- **Develop solutions** – what the system must do and how it must perform
- **Ensure business needs are met** – so the solution delivers value

Without clear requirements, projects often deliver the wrong thing or miss important needs.

## Part 2: Main Types of Requirements

| Type | What it means | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Functional requirements** | *What* the system must do – specific functions and features | “The system must process sales orders and create invoices.” |
| **Non-functional requirements** | *How well* the system must perform – performance, security, usability, reliability | “The system must respond within 2 seconds; data must be encrypted.” |
| **Stakeholder requirements** | Needs of different groups (business users, IT, management) | “Finance users need a monthly closing report; IT needs audit logs.” |
| **Technical requirements** | Infrastructure and technical specifications | “Must run on SAP HANA; must support 500 concurrent users.” |

## Part 3: Business Requirements in SAP

In SAP projects, the same types apply in a concrete way:

| Type in SAP | What it covers |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Functional requirements** | Which **SAP modules and functionalities** the system must support (e.g. Finance, HR, Sales, specific reports or workflows). |
| **Non-functional requirements** | **Performance** (response time, throughput), **security** (access, encryption), **usability** (e.g. SAP Fiori), **reliability** (uptime, backup). |
| **Stakeholder requirements** | Needs of **business users** (what they do daily), **IT** (integration, monitoring), **management** (reporting, compliance). |
| **Technical requirements** | **Infrastructure** (servers, database, network), **SAP technical specs** (version, add-ons, interfaces). |

### Think About It

**Why do we need both “functional” and “non-functional” requirements?** *(Hint: one says what the system does; the other says how well it must do it.)*

## 🎉 Key Takeaways

- **Business requirements** = activities, needs, and criteria to achieve goals; they define scope and guide solution design.
- **Functional** = what the system must do; **non-functional** = how well (performance, security, usability, reliability).
- **Stakeholder** = needs of different groups; **technical** = infrastructure and technical specs.
- In **SAP**, these map to modules/functions, performance/security/usability, user/IT/management needs, and infrastructure.
