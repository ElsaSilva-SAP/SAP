---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:
- ✅ Explain what business and organizational alignment means
- ✅ Name four alignment types: strategic, cultural, structural, operational
- ✅ Give simple examples of each
- ✅ Recognize tools and practices that support alignment (e.g. balanced scorecard, workshops)

## Part 1: What Is Business and Organizational Alignment?

**Business and organizational alignment** means ensuring that the **structure**, **culture**, and **operations** of an organization are in **harmony with its strategic objectives**.

When alignment is strong:
- Activities and resources support strategic goals
- Different parts of the organization work together effectively
- Performance is more predictable and easier to improve

When alignment is weak, departments may pull in different directions or work on the wrong priorities.

## Part 2: Four Types of Alignment

| Type | What it means | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Strategic alignment** | Organizational activities and resources are aligned with strategic objectives | Company strategy is “customer first”; projects and budgets prioritize customer experience. |
| **Cultural alignment** | Organizational culture supports business goals (values, behaviors, mindset) | Goals include innovation; culture encourages experimentation and learning from failure. |
| **Structural alignment** | Organization structure (teams, roles, reporting) supports strategy and processes | Cross-functional teams exist where collaboration is critical. |
| **Operational alignment** | Day-to-day operations support long-term strategic goals | Processes and KPIs are designed to deliver on the strategy. |

## Part 3: Tools and Practices That Support Alignment

Organizations often use:

- **Balanced Scorecard** – A framework that links strategy to measures in four areas (e.g. financial, customer, internal processes, learning and growth) so progress can be tracked.
- **Cultural change programs** – Initiatives to shift values and behaviors (e.g. toward agility, customer focus, or innovation).
- **Alignment workshops** – Sessions where teams clarify goals, roles, and how their work supports the strategy.
- **Organizational design** – Deliberately designing roles, teams, and reporting lines to support the strategy and key processes.

### Which Alignment Type?

**Scenario:** A company decides to “go digital” but most employees still prefer paper and email. Projects are delayed because people don’t use the new tools.  
**Which alignment is missing or weak?** ___________________________________________

*(Suggested: cultural alignment – culture and behaviors need to support the digital strategy.)*
