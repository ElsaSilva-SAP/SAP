## ✅ Suggested Answers

1. Functional (what the system does – approval workflow)  
2. Stakeholder / Technical (IT need; could be technical – integration)  
3. Non-functional (performance / capacity)  
4. Functional or Stakeholder (report = function; “Finance users need” = stakeholder)  
5. Non-functional (security / compliance – audit trail)  
6. Technical (infrastructure / platform)

---

## 🎉 Key Takeaway

- **Functional** = what the system does. **Non-functional** = how well (performance, security, usability). **Stakeholder** = who needs what. **Technical** = infrastructure and technical specs.
