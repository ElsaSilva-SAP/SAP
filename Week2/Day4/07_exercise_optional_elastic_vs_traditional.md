# Day 4 (Thursday): Optional Exercise – Elastic vs Traditional Computing
## *(Optional)* When to Choose Elastic (Cloud) vs Traditional (Fixed) Resources

This exercise is **optional**. Use it to connect **elastic computing** to real decisions.

---

## 🎯 What You Will Do

Write **one short scenario** where a company would typically choose **elastic (cloud)** resources and **one short scenario** where they might choose **traditional (fixed)** servers or resources.

---

## Scenario 1: Choose Elastic (Cloud)

**When elastic computing is a good fit:** Demand varies a lot; you want to pay for what you use; you want to scale quickly without buying hardware.

**Your scenario (2–3 sentences):** A company or situation where **elastic (cloud)** resources make sense.

**Example:** An e-commerce company has low traffic most of the year but huge spikes during Black Friday. They use cloud so they can scale up for the spike and scale down after, paying only for what they use.

## Scenario 2: Choose Traditional (Fixed)

**When traditional/fixed might be chosen:** Very stable, predictable workload; strict data residency or compliance that keeps data on-premise; long-term commitment to existing hardware.

**Your scenario (2–3 sentences):** A company or situation where **traditional (fixed)** servers or on-premise might be chosen.

**Example:** A government agency must keep certain data in their own data center for legal reasons. They use fixed servers and only move non-sensitive workloads to the cloud.

## 🎉 Key Takeaway

- **Elastic** = scale up/down with demand; good when demand varies and you want flexibility and pay-as-you-go.
- **Traditional/fixed** = predictable capacity; can be chosen for compliance, data location, or very stable workloads.
