# Day 3 (Wednesday): Group Exercise – Process Redesign
## Three Different Processes for Three Groups

Work in **one of three groups**. Each group has a **different process** to analyze and improve. Your group will describe the **current state**, suggest **2 improvements** (process redesign and/or technology), and present to the class.

---

## 👥 Group Setup

**Instructions:**
- The class is split into **3 groups**.
- **Group 1** → Process A (Order approval)
- **Group 2** → Process B (Leave request)
- **Group 3** → Process C (Invoice handling)
- In your group, assign roles: **Facilitator**, **Recorder**, **Presenter**
- Complete your group’s worksheet, then present in about **5 minutes**

**Your group number:** _____ (1 / 2 / 3)

**Your group members:**
1. ___________________________________________
2. ___________________________________________
3. ___________________________________________
4. ___________________________________________

**Your role:** ___________________________________________

## 📋 Process A – Group 1: Order Approval

**Your scenario:** A company receives **customer orders** (e.g. by email or phone). Currently: sales enter the order in a spreadsheet, then email it to the manager. The manager approves or rejects and emails back. Sales then manually enter approved orders into the system. This often causes delays and errors.

**Your task:**
1. **Current state:** In 2–3 sentences, describe the process and one main problem (e.g. bottleneck, delay, error).
2. **Improvement 1:** One change to the **process** (who does what, in what order, or how it is documented).
3. **Improvement 2:** One **technology** or tool that could help (e.g. workflow system, SAP, automated approval).

| | Your group's answer |
|---|---------------------|
| **Current state (2–3 sentences)** | ___________________________________________ |
| | ___________________________________________ |
| **Improvement 1 (process)** | ___________________________________________ |
| **Improvement 2 (technology)** | ___________________________________________ |

**Presentation:** In 5 min, explain the process, the problem, and your two improvements.

## 📋 Process B – Group 2: Leave Request

**Your scenario:** **Employees request leave** by sending an email to their manager. The manager replies “approved” or “rejected.” There is no central record; HR sometimes finds out only when preparing payroll. Sometimes leave is overbooked (too many people off at once).

**Your task:**
1. **Current state:** In 2–3 sentences, describe the process and one main problem.
2. **Improvement 1:** One change to the **process** (e.g. steps, roles, or documentation).
3. **Improvement 2:** One **technology** or tool that could help (e.g. leave system, calendar, SAP HR).

|                                   | Your group's answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Current state (2–3 sentences)** | Employees request leave by sending an email directly to their manager. The manager replies with “approved” or “rejected,” but there is no central system to document the decision. HR is often informed too late, and overlapping leave requests are not visible. |
|                                   | The main problem is the lack of transparency and central record, which leads to payroll errors and overbooking of leave.                                                                                                                                          |
| **Improvement 1 (process)**       | Introduce a standardized leave request process: all requests must be submitted through one official channel, and HR must automatically be notified after manager approval. Clear rules for checking team availability should be defined.                          |
| **Improvement 2 (technology)**    | Implement a digital leave management system (e.g. HR module in SAP or a cloud-based HR tool) with automated approval workflow and shared team calendar visibility.                                                                                                |
                                                                                             |


**Presentation:** In 5 min, explain the process, the problem, and your two improvements.

## 📋 Process C – Group 3: Invoice Handling

**Your scenario:** **Invoices from suppliers** arrive by post or email. Someone prints or saves them, then passes them to a colleague for checking. After checking, they go to another person for approval, then to finance for payment. Papers and emails get lost; it is hard to know the status of an invoice.

**Your task:**
1. **Current state:** In 2–3 sentences, describe the process and one main problem.
2. **Improvement 1:** One change to the **process** (e.g. single path, clear handoffs, or documentation).
3. **Improvement 2:** One **technology** or tool that could help (e.g. invoice workflow, SAP, digital approval).

| | Your group's answer |
|---|---------------------|
| **Current state (2–3 sentences)** | ___________________________________________ |
| | ___________________________________________ |
| **Improvement 1 (process)** | ___________________________________________ |
| **Improvement 2 (technology)** | ___________________________________________ |

**Presentation:** In 5 min, explain the process, the problem, and your two improvements.

## 📢 Presenting to the Class

**Presenter:** Share:
1. Which process your group had (Order approval / Leave request / Invoice handling)
2. Current state and **one main problem**
3. **Improvement 1** (process) and **Improvement 2** (technology)
4. One **change management** idea (how to help people adopt the new way)

**Notes for your presentation:**

## 🤔 Discussion (After All Groups)

**What was similar in how all three groups approached “process redesign”?**

## 🎉 Key Takeaways

- **Process redesign** = future state design + stakeholder input + technology + change management.
- Different **processes** (order, leave, invoice) need different **improvements**, but the **steps** (current state → issues → improvements) are the same.
- As a consultant, you will often **analyze current processes** and **propose process and technology improvements**.
