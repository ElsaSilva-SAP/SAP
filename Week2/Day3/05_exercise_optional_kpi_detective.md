# Day 3 (Wednesday): Optional Exercise – KPI Detective
## *(Optional)* Suggest KPIs for a Simple Process

This exercise is **optional**. Use it to reinforce **performance metrics / KPIs** from the slides.

---

## 🎯 What You Will Do

Pick a simple process and suggest **2 KPIs** that could measure its success. For each KPI, write **how you would measure** it (e.g. what data, what unit).

---

## Choose One Process

- [ ] **Order fulfillment** (from order placed to delivery)
- [ ] **Leave request** (from request submitted to approved/recorded)
- [ ] **Invoice handling** (from invoice received to payment sent)
- [ ] **Other:** ___________________________________________

**Process I chose:** ___________________________________________

---

## KPI 1

**Name of KPI:** ___________________________________________

**What it measures (in one sentence):** ___________________________________________

**How you would measure it (e.g. what data, what unit – time, count, percentage):**
> ___________________________________________
> ___________________________________________

---

## KPI 2

**Name of KPI:** ___________________________________________

**What it measures (in one sentence):** ___________________________________________

**How you would measure it:**
> ___________________________________________
> ___________________________________________

---

## 💡 Examples (for order fulfillment)

- **Order cycle time** – Measures: time from order placed to delivery. Measure: average number of days (or hours) per order.
- **On-time delivery rate** – Measures: share of orders delivered by the promised date. Measure: percentage (e.g. 95% on time).

---

## 🎉 Key Takeaway

- **KPIs** help track whether a process is meeting goals (speed, quality, cost, etc.).
- A good KPI is **clear** (what we measure) and **measurable** (how we get the number).
