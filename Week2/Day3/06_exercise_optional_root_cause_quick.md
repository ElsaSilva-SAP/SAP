# Day 3 (Wednesday): Optional Exercise – Root Cause Quick Practice
## *(Optional)* Use the “5 Whys” to Dig Deeper

This exercise is **optional**. Use it to practice **root cause analysis** (from process analysis).

---

## 🎯 What You Will Do

You are given **one process problem**. Use a simple **“5 Whys”** approach: ask **“Why?”** 2–3 times (or more) and write the chain. The **last “why”** in your chain should point to a possible **root cause**.

---

## The Problem

**“Orders are often late.”**

---

## Your 5 Whys Chain

**Why are orders often late?**

**Why 1:** ___________________________________________

**Why 2:** ___________________________________________

**Why 3:** ___________________________________________

*(Optional – add more if it helps)*

**Why 4:** ___________________________________________

**Why 5:** ___________________________________________

---

## What Is the Root Cause?

**From your chain, what do you think is a root cause (not just a symptom)?**

## 💡 Example Chain (you can use different ideas)

- **Why are orders often late?** Because trucks leave the warehouse late.
- **Why do trucks leave late?** Because loading takes too long.
- **Why does loading take too long?** Because the picking list is often not ready on time.
- **Why is the picking list not ready?** Because orders are only printed once a day in the morning.
- **Root cause (example):** Orders are batched and printed once per day, so late-morning orders wait until the next day for picking – leading to late shipments. A possible fix: more frequent order release or real-time picking lists.

## 🤔 Short Reflection *(Optional)*

**Why is it useful to find the “root cause” instead of only fixing the first reason we see?**

## 🎉 Key Takeaway

- **Root cause analysis** looks for the **underlying cause** of a problem, not just the obvious one.
- The **5 Whys** = keep asking “Why?” until you reach a cause that you can address (process, system, or behavior).
