# Day 3 (Wednesday): Understanding Business Goals and Process Alignment
## Business Processes, KPIs, Process Mapping, Analysis, and Redesign

Yesterday you finished digital transformation and practical application. **Today** we focus on **Business goals and process alignment** – how to ensure business activities and workflows support the organization’s objectives.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:
- ✅ Explain what business processes are and name their types (core, support, management)
- ✅ Describe why documentation and optimization matter
- ✅ Define performance metrics / KPIs and their role
- ✅ Explain process mapping (definition, types, benefits) and give a simple example
- ✅ Describe process analysis (current state, issues, benchmarking, root cause)
- ✅ Describe process redesign (future state, stakeholders, technology, change management)

## 📌 Recap

- **Day 1:** SAP product strategy, functional vs technical modules, CRM, industry applications.
- **Day 2:** Technical modules, enterprise systems environment, digital transformation (impact, technology, culture, CX, strategy, leadership, workforce, data).
- **Today:** Aligning business processes with goals – processes, KPIs, mapping, analysis, redesign.

## Part 1: Aligning Business Goals and Processes

**Overview:** Aligning business processes with organizational goals means making sure **all activities and workflows support the organization’s objectives**. This helps maximize efficiency, improve performance, and achieve strategic goals.

So we need to:
- Understand what **business processes** are
- **Measure** them (performance metrics / KPIs)
- **Map** them (visualize the workflow)
- **Analyze** them (find inefficiencies and root causes)
- **Redesign** them (improve and align with goals)

## Part 2: Business Processes

### Definition

**Business processes** are the **series of activities and workflows** carried out to achieve specific business objectives.

More formally: **Structured sets of activities or tasks** that produce a **specific service or product** for a particular customer or market. They involve **inputs**, **activities**, and **outputs**.

### Types

| Type | What it means | Examples |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Core processes** | Main value-creating processes | Manufacturing, sales, order fulfillment |
| **Support processes** | Enable the organization to run | HR, IT, finance, procurement |
| **Management processes** | Planning, controlling, improving | Strategic planning, compliance, risk management |

### Documentation

Business processes should be **documented** in detail:
- How tasks are performed
- Who is responsible
- What resources are required

Documentation supports **training**, **standardization**, and **continuous improvement**.

### Optimization

**Optimization** = regularly reviewing and improving processes for better efficiency, lower cost, and higher quality. Common approaches include **Lean**, **Six Sigma**, and **Total Quality Management (TQM)**.

---

## Part 3: Performance Metrics (KPIs)

**Performance metrics**, or **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**, are used to **measure success** and **track progress** toward strategic goals.

Examples:
- Order cycle time (how long from order to delivery)
- Customer satisfaction score
- Error rate or defect rate
- Cost per unit

Without KPIs, it is hard to know if a process is improving or aligned with goals.

---

## Part 4: Process Mapping

**Process mapping** = **diagramming processes** to understand the workflow, find improvement areas, and ensure alignment with goals.

### Definition

The **visual representation** of a process: sequence of tasks, decision points, inputs, and outputs. It helps people understand and analyze the workflow.

### Types of Process Maps

- **Flowcharts** – steps and decisions in sequence
- **Swimlane diagrams** – steps grouped by role or department (who does what)
- **Value stream maps** – flow of materials and information, often in manufacturing
- **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)** – standard notation for business processes

### Benefits

- Find **inefficiencies**, **redundancies**, and **bottlenecks**
- Clarify **roles and responsibilities**
- Improve **communication**
- Support **training and onboarding**

### Improvement

By mapping processes, organizations can **pinpoint areas for improvement**, **streamline workflows**, and **align processes with strategic goals** – leading to better efficiency, lower costs, and improved service.

### Simple Example: Order-to-Cash (High Level)

1. Customer places order → 2. Order validated → 3. Goods picked and shipped → 4. Invoice sent → 5. Payment received → 6. Payment recorded.

Each step can be broken down further; mapping makes handoffs and bottlenecks visible.

## Part 5: Process Analysis

**Process analysis** = **evaluating current processes** to find inefficiencies and bottlenecks. It is essential for alignment and continuous improvement.

| Element | What it means |
|---------|----------------|
| **Current state analysis** | Understanding how the process works today (e.g. process mapping, time and motion studies, data analysis) |
| **Identify issues** | Finding inefficiencies, delays, redundancies, bottlenecks (e.g. manual handoffs, lack of standardization, poor resource allocation) |
| **Benchmarking** | Comparing with industry best practices or competitors to find gaps and opportunities |
| **Root cause analysis** | Finding the real causes of issues using methods like **5 Whys**, **fishbone diagrams**, or **Pareto analysis** |

**5 Whys (simple):** Ask “Why?” several times. Example: “Orders are often late” → Why? “Trucks leave late.” → Why? “Loading takes too long.” → Why? “Picking list is not ready on time.” → So the root cause might be planning or system readiness, not just “late trucks.”

---

## Part 6: Process Redesign

**Process redesign** = **modifying processes** to align better with business goals and improve performance.

| Element | What it means |
|---------|----------------|
| **Future state design** | Defining the desired end state: efficient, effective workflows aligned with strategic goals |
| **Stakeholder input** | Involving people who use or are affected by the process so the new design meets their needs and gains support |
| **Technology integration** | Using technology to automate tasks, improve communication, and streamline workflows (e.g. ERP, SAP, AI) |
| **Change management** | Managing the move to the new process: communication, training, and support so people adopt it and resistance is reduced |
